<h3>What are the symptoms?</h3>
<h4>This disease has many symptoms depending on the severeness of the case. Mild cases have no cases, but larger ones include numbness, stiffness, or plain pain in the legs or arms, because arteries are located there. It also includes pain in the chest near the heart. All of these are signs that you might have this disease. Symptoms of this disease, however, will not occur until the artery is almost completely blocked so that it cannot transport an adequate amount of blood at this point. Then, when there is no or too much blood in one place, the symptoms are triggered. This disease that can also cause or include diabetes and stroke.</h4>
